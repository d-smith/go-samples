Some simple go example while reading through An Introduction to
Programming in Go, reading through the Go Tour, etc.

To istall math.go and to run the packaging sample, set GOLANG to the ROOT
directory of this repo then run `go install`. Note the location of the .git directory is not
per convention, this is a reflection of not knowing conventional project
structure when starting to mess around with go.
